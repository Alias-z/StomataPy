# StomataPy
State of the art stomata segmentation tools for the phenotyping era

 # Aim
 We are about to release pre-trained stomata segmentation models that are powered by a large dataset of fine-granular annotated images.
 Everyone could run the models in Google Colab or locally for automatic stomatal segmentations.  <br>

 **We call for the contribution from the stomata community for a stomata 'ImageNet'**  <br>
 **If you want to contribute or request a function, please submit an issue or contact me at: hongyuan.zhang@usys.ethz.ch**

 # Functions showcase

**Stomata detection and segmentation**
<br>
We aim for both peels (tapping methods) and imprints (nail polish)
